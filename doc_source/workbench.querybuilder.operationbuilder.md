# Building Complex Operations<a name="workbench.querybuilder.operationbuilder"></a>

The operation builder in NoSQL Workbench for Amazon DynamoDB provides a visual interface where you can perform complex data plane operations\. It includes support for projection expressions and condition expressions\. You can also choose to generate sample code for these operations, in multiple languages\.

The NoSQL Workbench supports building [PartiQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.html) for DynamoDB statements, which allows you to interact with Dynamodb using a SQL\-compatible query language\. The NoSQL Workbench also supports building DynamoDB CRUD API operations\.

To use the NoSQL Workbench to build operations, in the navigation pane on the left side, choose the **Operation builder** icon\.
